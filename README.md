# Responsible Data Science (Adult dataset)
This project revolves around the concept of responsible data science, using the UCI Adult dataset, which contains records of people categorized using different attributes, like age, sex, education, marital status etc.
The goal of the classifier we built was to predict the salary of that person, but we explored also the concept of fairness, privacy and explainability.
The project was part of the first semester of the Erasmus Mundus project called BDMA and for the subject called Management of Data Science and Business Workflows, teached at ULB.

# Run locally
Everything should be packed up in the .ipynb notebook. It should be already quite well self documented with Markdown cells but to understand more one can read both the presentation slides and the final report of the project.
